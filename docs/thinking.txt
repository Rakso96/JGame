Advanced ball collisions....


Calculate center coordinate of the player and the ball and subtract them
Set  the balls y velocity equal to the outcome
This will make realistic bouncing off the paddle, But too sensitive

Create variable to tone down the outcome of center of player subtracted by center of ball.
float tuner = 0,05; ~ 

BallVelocityY = (Player.getCenter() - ball.getCenter) * tuner;
