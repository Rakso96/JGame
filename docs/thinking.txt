Advanced ball collisions....


Calculate center coordinate of the player and the ball and subtract them
Set  the balls y velocity equal to the outcome
This will make realistic bouncing off the paddle, But too sensitive

Create variable to tone down the outcome of center of player subtracted by center of ball.
float tuner = 0,05; ~ 

BallVelocityY = (Player.getCenter() - ball.getCenter) * tuner;


Draw score:

In the ball class add two methods one for playerPoint and one for enemyPoint()
inside the method make a int go ++ and then a boolean set to true 
in the Draw method of the ball go if(enemyScore == true) draw EnemyScore: enemyInt
